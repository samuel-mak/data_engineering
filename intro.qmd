# Basic computing

**Computer programme**

- **Definition**
  - A set of computerised instructions (e.g. codes) executed by a computer(s) to perform specific tasks
  
**Software**

- **Definition**
  - A package of computer programmes, data, and documents for computers to perform a set of specific and usually related tasks and manage the package (e.g. organising, updating, memory management)
  
  
**Application**

- **Definition**
  - Usually refers to the front-end of a usually lighter-weight software 
  
**Server**

- **Definition**
  - A computer programme that serves a client or clients in a network by receiving and responding to service request from individual clients
  - There are different types of servers, e.g. web server, database server, file server, gaming server, application server 
  
  
**Client**
- A client is something that sends requests to a server



**Engine**

- **Definition**
  - The core component of something that serves as the foundation of the thing (e.g. performs the fundamental functionality of that thing) 

**Data**

- **Definition**
  - Computerised information
  - Information that is essentially transformed into a series of 1s and 0s to represent that information


**Database**
  
- **Definition**
  - A collection of data that are usually related in some way (e.g. meaning/process/data flow/purpose)
  
  
**Data store**

- **Definition**
  - A repository for storing/organising and/or managing data 
  - It can be as simple as a file system (e.g. text files, csv files, JSON files) or as complex as a DBMS
  
  
**Database server**

- **Definition**
  - A server of a DBMS 
  - A server that serves clients with regards to a DBMS
  - E.g. MS SQL Server is a database server of the MS SQL DBMS, end-users might communicate with the server through its GUI called MS SQL Server Management Studio
  
  
**Database management system (DBMS)**
  
- **Definition**
  - A system for managing data (e.g. storage, organisation, optimisation)
  - E.g. Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite
  - A DBMS involves a database engine for storing and managing data and may involve a database server, a GUI for end-users to interact with the engine, and other service and tools (depending on the DBMS and edition/version)
  
**Database system**

- **Definition**
  - A database system refers to the combination of data, the DBMS that manages them, and any hardware hosting them
  
**Data lake/warehouse/mart**

- **Introduction**
  - This is a data management system that cut all available data into subsets in order to support business needs 

- **Data lake**
  - A database that stores data that are not necessarily ready to be used by downstream users (usually raw and unstructured)
- **Data warehouse**
  - A database that stores data that are ready to be used by all downstream users (usually relatively structured, clean, concise, accessible/intuitive compared to those in data lake)
- **Data mart**
  - A subset of data warehouse that is targeted for specific downstream users (e.g. a department/team or unit within a department)
  
**Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)**

- **Definition**
  - An ODBC is a connection between an software/application (e.g. R, Python, SPSS, Excel) and a DBMS
  
**ODBC interface**

- **Definition**
  - An API that manages one or more ODBCs
  - Provides a standard and general set of calls/commands (via ODBC functions) for softwares/applications to ODBC compliant DBMS (e.g. executing an SQL script), this standarisation and generalisation enables an ODBC to be independent of applications
  - Developed by Microsoft in early 1990s
  
  
**ODBC driver**

- **Concept**
  - An ODBC driver provides a connection between an ODBC interface and a DBMS
  - An ODBC interface connects to different ODBC drivers as different DBMSs operate differently thus have their own specific DBMS function calls
  - An ODBC driver translates ODBC function calls into DBMS-specific function calls and passes them to the specific DBMS
  - This enables an ODBC interface to be independent of DBMSs
  - E.g. The old SQL Server and the new ODBC for SQL Server (these are drivers, despite having the word "servers" in their names)
